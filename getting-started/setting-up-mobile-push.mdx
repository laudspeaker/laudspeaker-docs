This tutorial will show with an end to end example how to trigger a mobile push campaign. It includes a very simple ios or android application, and shows how to use the laudspeaker mobile sdks, how to trigger events, connect a journey, and finally sends a push notification.

### Setting up firebase in Laudspeaker

The first step in being able to send push notificaitons is setting up firebase in Laudspeaker. 

You need to navigate to the settings page, select push

Then you can select the platforms you will use (iOS and/or Android)

After which you will be prompted to add the firebase service account JSON key file.

This can be found in your firebase console: `https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/[YOUR_PROJECT_NAME]/settings/serviceaccounts/adminsdk`. The page looks like the screenshot below and you generate the file by pressing the `Generate new private key` button

Once uploaded the page should look something like this and you are good to go! You can skip uploading users at this point.

### Setting up your user schema and user primary key

To be able to add users you will need to tell Laudspeaker how you want to uniquely identify your users. For example you may have a special `user_id` field to uniquely define your users. To do this you need to navigate to the People page under Audience.

Then click on the Settings button.

Here you can define your user's attributes and their types. Whats important for this tutorial is to add your unique identifier, and  then make sure it is selected as primary key

### Starting up the tutorial app

We have two sample projects you can use, and ios and android one.

Simply clone the project from our github repository here https://github.com/laudspeaker/react-toy-app .You'll need to do is change the api key and the application should work as intended. Then go ahead and run two commands

```
npm install 
```

```
npm run dev
```

If you navigate to localhost on your browser the application should look like this:

When you complete the journey, and link your app correctly when you click on reactivation, news or invoice you will be sent a specific email as shown in the video below.

## Understanding the application

If you navigate to the `App.vue` you will see how events are fired.

```
<template>
  <div>
    <div class="bg-[#F3F4F6] w-full min-h-screen">
      <div class="p-[50px] flex justify-around gap-[20px]">
        <button v-on:click="eventTest('reactivations')">reactivation</button>
        <br />
        <button v-on:click="eventTest('newslater')">news</button>
        <br />
        <button v-on:click="eventTest('invoices')">invoice</button>
        <br />
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
```

Each button, has a handler on a click `eventTest` , where we fire an event. The event is a `POST` request to `https://api.laudspeaker.com/events` with the following structure

```
correlationKey: 'email',
correlationValue: '[your email here]',
source: 'custom',
event

```

### Creating and starting our journey

This journey is available as a template on your account, which you can navigate to `to do`.

We will explain its structure.

When a user is enrolled in the journey, they start in the start step and then move to the wait until trigger. In the wait until step the users unsurprisingly, wait until, one of three events are triggered. The user then moves to the email step, receives the corresponding email, and then with the jump to loops back to the wait until step until another event is triggered.

### Putting it all together

Set the journey live, and then re-start the app. Now when you click on the button, you should receive an email.

This tutorial shows how the basic ideas behind Laudspeaker work in practice.
