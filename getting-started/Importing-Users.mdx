### How to import users

<Warning>Start at the "Setting up Laudspeaker" page before progressing here [Laudspeaker UI](https://app.laudspeaker.com/).</Warning>

After setting up the user schema, you can import users.

Laudspeaker imports or creates users in 3 main ways.

1) via CSV import
2) Programatically via the Upsert API
3) Automatically on events through the event API

#### CSV Import

You can import users through our csv import via the audience tab:

#### Upsert API

Laudspeaker offers an upsert api, where you can create users individually. You can check out the developer reference here (). 

#### Automatically via events

Laudspeaker can ingest events via the events api. If Laudspeaker encounters a user who does not yet exist in the database, Laudspeaker will automatically create that user in the audience tab.
