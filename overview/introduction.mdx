Laudspeaker is an open source customer engagement suite (also called marketing automation software). If you've used tools like Firebase cloud messaging, braze, one signal, airship, iterable, customer io or some others, Laudspeaker is an alternative to them. The main things that you can do with laudspeaker are

1) Create segments: defining which of your users should receive messages
2) Create messaging journeys: defining when, where and with which channels you want to reach users. 

Right now we support push, email, SMS, and soon we'll also include in-app messages and WhatsApp.
