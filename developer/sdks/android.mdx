Or manually from our repo available here: https://github.com/laudspeaker/laudspeaker-swift-sdk

This package includes our NotificationExtensionService as well which you may use if you want rich push too.

You also need to make sure firebase is installed correctly in your application, and incllude the right GoogleService-Info / Info files in your project
