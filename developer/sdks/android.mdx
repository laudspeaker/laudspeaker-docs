### Installing Firebase

You need to make sure firebase is installed correctly in your application, before you can use Laudspeaker. To start you need to include the right google-services.json file in your project.

To do that change your view in android studio to the project view, and move the google-services.json file (which you can get from your firebase account) into into your module (app-level) root directory.

Then you need to add the google services gradle plugin in the **project-level** build.gradle.kts

```
plugins {
  // ...

  // Add the dependency for the Google services Gradle plugin
  id("com.google.gms.google-services") version "4.4.2" apply false

}
```

after that:

in your module (app-level) build.gradle.kts file, add both the google-services plugin and the Firebase SDKs that we need in your app:

```
plugins {
  id("com.android.application")

  // Add the Google services Gradle plugin
  id("com.google.gms.google-services") version "4.4.0" apply false

  ...
  }

dependencies {
  // Import the Firebase BoM
  implementation(platform("com.google.firebase:firebase-bom:33.3.0"))
  implementation("com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging:23.4.0")
}

```
