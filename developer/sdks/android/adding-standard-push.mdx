### Integration

To use Laudspeaker you need to import Laudspeaker core, and then initialize with the right endpoint, and api key. You can find your api key in Laudspeakers settings page

Here is an example code snippet:

```
package com.laudspeaker.myapplication
import com.laudspeaker.android.LaudspeakerAndroid
import com.laudspeaker.android.LaudspeakerAndroidConfig
import org.koin.android.ext.koin.androidContext
import org.koin.dsl.module

val appModule = module {
    single {
        val config = LaudspeakerAndroidConfig(
            this.androidContext(),
            "WjzfCfRwSXDtG3H6u72b4PGate0B1a4MDhu51j0x", //your api key found in laudspeaker settings
            "https://app.laudspeaker.com/api",
            MainActivity::class.java // Might need to adjust based on actual usage
        )
        LaudspeakerAndroid.with(get(), config)
    }
}
```
After that you need to connect:

```
something
```

At this point your app should be able to receive push messages!

### Testing

To test, you will need a real device, and access to its firebase device token

Then go to the template page and create a push notification, and follow the same steps (just without an image) as in the rich push tutorial
