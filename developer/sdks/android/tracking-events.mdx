### Event Types

Laudspeaker supports the tracking a few different types of events. 

These include `default events`, `message events`, and `custom events`.

#### Default Events

Default events are tracked everytime a user uses your brand's app, and includes the following:

`identify`

We are in the process of adding:

`start session`

#### Message Events

When a user opens a push notification, or interacts with an in-app message we also track those interactions, and these events can be used in journeys to trigger messages, or in segments as additional filters.

#### Custom Events

You can configure the tracking of custom events in your application, that are unique or important to your business.

You can track a custom event by using the Laudspaker.fire function, which takes in an `event` as a parameter which is a string representing the name of your event and optionally a `payload``.

### Example Implementation

Here's an example with SwiftUI

```
import SwiftUI
import LaudspeakerCore

class LaudspeakerManager: ObservableObject {
    let laudspeaker: LaudspeakerCore
    
    init() {
        laudspeaker = LaudspeakerCore(url: "https://laudspeaker.com/", apiKey: "[YOUR_KEY]")
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject private var laudspeakerManager = LaudspeakerManager()
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            
            Button("Connect") {
                laudspeakerManager.laudspeaker.connect()
            }
            
            Button("fire event") {
                laudspeakerManager.laudspeaker.fire(event: "example_event")
            }
            
            Button("Get customerId") {
                print(laudspeakerManager.laudspeaker.getCustomerId())
            }
            Button("Disconnect") {
                laudspeakerManager.laudspeaker.disconnect()
            }
            
        }
        .padding()
    }
}



struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}

```
