### Introduction

We offer webhook functionality, as part of a journey. To create a webhook you should navigate to the templates section of the app.

### Setting up a webhook
We'll show you how to use a webhook with a real life example: making a post request to posthog about an email being sent to a specific user.

The fist step is going to template page, and select the webhook dropdown when creating a new template

You'll then need to specify the url you wish laudspeaker to notify, as well as the HTTP method, (we support GET or POST amongst others)

For our example, we make the url `https://app.posthog.com/capture` and the method is `POST`

To specify the content you'll need to click on the content tab, shown in the screenshot

and then add the content, that you want to send over:

We want to specify the id of the user who was sent an email, so we use the dynamic tag `{{ posthogId[0] }}` shown below

```js
{
    "api_key": "someapikey",
    "event": "email sent",
    "properties": {
        "distinct_id": "{{ posthogId[0] }}"
    }
}
```

You'll also then want to specify the type of content in the drop down. We used a json in this example

You can test the webhook is properly configured, by first selecting a test user whose data will be used. To do this enter the email of a user, who exists in the people page in the "Test customer email" input 
![mail](/images/guides/product-manual/whemail.png)

Then click test! If its successful you'll see an appropriate response, and the webhook should have been registered by the its destination.

### Using a webhook in a journey

Now that we have a webhook template set up we can use it in a journey like a regular message step.

Simply drag the webhook step to the journey and connect it to a preceding step with a trigger of your choice. In our journey we use a time delay step with a delay of 1 minute.
