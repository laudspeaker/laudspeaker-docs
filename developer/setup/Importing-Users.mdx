### How to import users

<Warning>Start at the "Setting up Laudspeaker" page before progressing here [Laudspeaker UI](https://app.laudspeaker.com/).</Warning>

After setting up the user schema, you can import users.

Laudspeaker imports or creates users in 3 main ways.

1) via CSV import
2) Programatically via the Upsert API
3) Automatically on events through the event API

#### CSV Import

To see how to import users via the api, check out product guide ()

#### Upsert API

Laudspeaker offers an upsert api, where you can create users individually. You can check out the reference here (). 

The user schema must be set before you can use the upsert api.

The main things to keep in mind is to not include system attributes in your upsert, but apart from that you can assign other attributes, including message channels like push tokens for example

#### Automatically via events

Laudspeaker can ingest events via the events api. If Laudspeaker encounters a user who does not yet exist in the database, Laudspeaker will automatically create that user in the audience tab.
