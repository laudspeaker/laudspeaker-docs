### Laudspeaker Event Structure

Laudspeaker supports the ingestion of events, and can ingest at a high throughput. Our endpoint `https://app.laudspeaker.com/api/events/batch/` accepts events in batches. From as little as one event in a batch. Lets start off with an example you can run and then explain what is happening:

You can adapt the following curl example, by adding your api key (found in settings)

![2](/images/guides/getting-started/api_key.png)



```
curl --location 'https://app.laudspeaker.com/api/events/batch/' \
--header 'Authorization: Api-Key [your_key_here]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "batch": [
    {

      },
      "correlationValue": "FBBBCB26-B75E-4342-B40B-568BF879F7C5"
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "2024-03-15T02:31:05.313Z",
      "uuid": "A97E8A44-AAB0-45C6-B68D-3CAD9A0ED0DD",
      "correlationKey": "_id",
      "correlationValue": "FBBBCB26-B75E-4342-B40B-568BF879F7C5",

      "timestamp": "2024-03-15T02:31:05.443Z",
      "uuid": "C3EE7322-CBA2-49C4-B118-87DD86AAA5D0",
      "event": "item_to_cart"
    }
  ]
}'

```

and you should see the resulting events in the event tracker!

### Breaking down the batch of events

A batch consists of an array of events and looks like this:

```
{
    "batch": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2024-03-15T02:31:05.295Z",
      "uuid": "F451DF0A-D713-4076-AE20-41AB1641BC98",
      "event": "checking_out",
      "source": "custom"
      "correlationKey": "_id",
      "payload": {
        "checkout": true
      },
      "correlationValue": "FBBBCB26-B75E-4342-B40B-568BF879F7C5"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each event in the batch must adhere to the laudspeaker schema, at a minimum each event must contain an **event** field, **correlationKey** field, **correlationValue** field, and a **source** set to **"custom"**

Optionally it should also contain a timestamp, and uuid like below:

```
    {
      "timestamp": "2024-03-15T02:31:05.295Z",
      "uuid": "F451DF0A-D713-4076-AE20-41AB1641BC98",
      "event": "checking_out",
      "source": "custom"
      "correlationKey": "_id",
      "correlationValue": "FBBBCB26-B75E-4342-B40B-568BF879F7C5"
    }

```

To customize your event with data you want to send, you should include a payload object:

```
    {
      "timestamp": "2024-03-15T02:31:05.295Z",
      "uuid": "F451DF0A-D713-4076-AE20-41AB1641BC98",
      "event": "checking_out",
      "source": "custom"
      "payload": {
        "checkout": true
      },
      "correlationKey": "_id",
      "correlationValue": "FBBBCB26-B75E-4342-B40B-568BF879F7C5"
    }

```

Putting everything together an event batch could look like:

```
{
    "batch": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2024-03-15T02:31:05.295Z",
      "uuid": "F451DF0A-D713-4076-AE20-41AB1641BC98",
      "event": "checking_out",
      "source": "mobile"
      "correlationKey": "_id",
      "payload": {
        "checkout": true
      },
      "correlationValue": "FBBBCB26-B75E-4342-B40B-568BF879F7C5"
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "2024-03-15T02:31:05.313Z",
      "uuid": "A97E8A44-AAB0-45C6-B68D-3CAD9A0ED0DD",
      "correlationKey": "_id",
      "correlationValue": "FBBBCB26-B75E-4342-B40B-568BF879F7C5",
      "source": "mobile",
      "event": "marketing_agreed",
      "payload": {
        "agreed_to_marketing": true
      }
    },
  ]
}
```

### API Endpoint

Our event endpoint is:

`https://app.laudspeaker.com/api/events/batch/`


### Identifying users

We are able to attribute events to the right users by using the correlationValue and correlationKey pair. The correlationKey tells Laudspeaker which unique attribute of a user to use when correlating an event with a user, and for custom events **should always be set to the primary key** of the user. The primary key of your users is set up under the audience tab:
