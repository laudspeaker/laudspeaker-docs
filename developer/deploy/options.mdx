<Info> We are not currently providing support for self hosting unless you are on a paid plan, we strongly recommend using our cloud product if you want to try the project before deciding if you want to self deploy</Info>


### Laudspeaker Cloud
We recommend you use Laudspeaker cloud, you can see a simple example in this tutorial setting-up-first-journey-with-the-react-sdk 


### Docker
Run services:

- `docker-compose up` or `docker compose up` depending on your version of docker

Instantiate Mongo:

- `mongosh --eval "rs.initiate()"`

Run backend and front end:

- `npm install`
- `npm run start`

To stop running system services (Linux):

- Postgres: `sudo systemctl stop postgresql.service`
- Redis: `/etc/init.d/redis-server stop`
- Mongo: `sudo systemctl stop mongod`

To remove compose containers:

- `docker-compose down --volumes`

Add a `.env` file to both `packages/server` and `packages/client`.

We have provided examples which you can use:

`mv env-server-example packages/server/.env` and `mv env-client-example packages/client/.env`

Make sure you fill in the fields in the env files before running.
