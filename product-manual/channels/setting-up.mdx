## Supported Channels

Currently Laudspeaker supports, the following channels - **push**, **email**, **sms**, and **webhook** on the cloud product as well as push notifications, and modals (in beta) and on the enterprise self-hosted edition.

To use most messaging channels in the journey builder you need to properly set up the messaging channel before hand. For example to use email, you need to set up sending address, and connect Laudspeaker to your domain. There are similar requirements for sms, push and other channels
